### 🔺 Agile Estimation


1. Who estimates the effort to complete a product backlog item (a user story)?

  - ✅ The scrum development team after clarifying the requirement.
  - ❌ The scrum master with input from the scrum development team.
  - ❌ The most senior people in the organization such as the engineering managers and the chief architect.
  - ❌ The product owner with input from the scrum development team.
  > True. Ideally, we want the development team that is going to implement the stories to estimate the work. Of course, they will need to clarify requirements to make sure they are building the thing that was expected in the story.
  
2. What is true about Agile Estimation techniques? Select two.

  - ✅ Estimates are shared.
  > True. Agile techniques support collaborative methods of estimation resulting in shared estimates.
  - ✅ They estimate effort and not duration.
  > When stories are estimated, do you think team think about duration of the story or amount of effort it will take? Watch video "Agile Estimation and Planning"
  - ❌ No planning, No estimation. It is considered non productive activity.
  - ❌ The senior-most person should create estimates and get feedback from team members.

3. In following scenario which type of estimation was used?

**_"It takes 3 days to implement 1 screen so it will take 30 days to implement 10 screens."_**

  - ✅ Parametric
  - ❌ Analogous
  - ❌ Top down
  - ❌ Expert Opinion
  > True. Since we are estimating based on number of units, it is a parametric estimation

4. Which of the following estimates represents concept of relative sizing? Select three.

  - ❌ Story A will take 1.5 ideal days, Story B will take 5 ideal days and Story C will take 3.5 Ideal Days
  - ❌ Story A will take 1 day, Story B will take 5 Days and Story C will take 10 days
  - ✅ Story A will take half the time Story B will take. Story C will take double the time Story A will take.
  > Relative sizing because story estimates are specified relative to each other.
  - ✅ Story A is 1 apple, Story B is 5 apples, and Story C is 10 apples
  > Relative sizing because stories are estimated in arbitrary unit of "Apple".
  - ✅ Story A is bigger than Story B. Story C is smaller than Story A.
  > Relative sizing because story estimates are specified relative to each other.

5. What is true about the planning poker estimation technique? Select three.

  - ✅ It helps uncover misunderstandings.
  > True. In planning poker, if the estimates of two individuals are far apart, it may be due to different understandings of the story. This results in further discussion of the story and helps build a shared understanding.
  - ✅ Everyone involved in development has to participate in estimation.
  > True. In planning poker, everybody has to show their estimate.
  - ❌ It is a superfast technique to estimate lots of stories in a short amount of time.
  - ✅ It supports the concept of shared estimates.
  > Since everybody participates in estimation, it helps create estimates that are shared by all team members.

6. Which of the following observations are true about Card Sorting? Select two.

  - ✅ It is very useful for estimating a large number of stories.
  > True. In this method, a large number of stories can be estimated in a short amount of time.
  - ❌ It is a very inaccurate method of estimation.
  - ✅ This technique benefits from using relative sizing.
  > Since we are estimating many stories, we use relative sizing to order stories from small to large in size.
  - ❌ Not everybody on the development team participates in this method.

7. What is true about estimation using Ideal Days? Select two.

  - ❌ It is relative sizing technique.
  - ❌ It is very fast to estimate.
  - ✅ It is very natural for a new team member to understand.
  > True. Since it is absolute, a new team member does not need to understand the scale used by the team.
  - ✅ It has a potential issue of "My ideal days are not your ideal days".
  > True. When you estimate in ideal days, estimates by an expert may be very different than a novice for same story.

8. In following scenario which type of estimation was used?

**_Product P consists of component A, B and C._**


- **_Component A is estimated to take 3 days._**

- **_Component B is estimated to take 4 days._**

- **_Component C is estimated to take 2 days._**

- **_So Estimate for Product P is 9 days._**


  - ✅ Bottom-up Estimation
  - ❌ Parametric
  - ❌ Analogous
  - ❌ Top-down Estimation
  > In bottom-up estimation, we start from the bottom and aggregate results at higher level

-------------------------

### 🔺 Release Planning and Tracking

1. Calculate the velocity range a team should use to select work for next iteration based on their past velocities (see chart below). The team uses the last 5 iterations to estimate their velocity. Use format "from-to" to specify the answer (e.g., 0-100).

Table 1: The velocity of previous iterations

|Iteration|Story points completed|
|:---:|:---:|
|1|14|
|2|18|
|3|23|
|4|17|
|5|15|
|6|21|
|7|22|
|8|20|

**15-22**

> Since there are no anomalies, the velocity range is the minimum velocity to the maximum velocity of the last 5 iterations (iterations 4 to 8).

2. A team was doing release planning and they decided that the next release will include all stories from Story 1 to Story 11 (see table 2 below).

- The velocity range to be used for the release planning is 15-22.
- The team works in a 2 week iteration.
- It costs about $50,000 per iteration to fund the entire team.

Calculate the estimated duration for next release. Additionally, how much will this release cost?

Table 2: Prioritized Product Backlog


  - ✅ Duration: 6-8 weeks, Cost: 150K to 200K
  - ❌ Duration: 3-4 weeks, Cost: 150K to 200K
  - ❌ Duration: 10-14 weeks, Cost: 500K to 700K
  - ❌ Duration: 6-8 weeks, Cost: 300K to 400K

Total estimate of stories from S1 to S11 = 58

With velocity 15, it will take 58 / 15 => 4 iterations => 8 weeks

With velocity 22, it will take 58/22 => 3 iterations => 6 weeks

So duration is 6-8 weeks

Since it costs $50K per iteration, it will cost between:

$50K * 3 iterations = $150K and $50K * 4 iterations = $200K

3. Select scenarios below where the team used the correct approach to handle special cases of team velocity.


  - ❌ A new team member is going to join the team in the next iteration, so the team adjusted their velocity appropriately and selected more work to do in the iteration
  - ✅ To forecast velocity for first iteration,
      - 1) the team builds deeper understanding of few stories from the backlog
      - 2) From the understood stories, they select stories they feel they can get done in one sprint.
      - 3) The sum the estimates of the selected stories is the team's forecasted velocity.
  > Correct. This is a decent strategy for forecasting velocity.
  - ❌ The team is getting more defects / support work so they are not able to finish the stories selected for the current sprint. The team estimated that it takes 30% of team capacity to handle support work. The team decided to reduce velocity by 30% and use it for future iteration.
  - ✅ One of the team members is taking a couple days off in next iteration, but the team didn't adjust its velocity to reflect that.
  > Correct. Since we don't know the exact impact of a team member taking some time off and there will always be somebody taking a couple days off, let the velocity take care of it.
  
4. Which of the following methods can help you track a release? (select any 2)

 - ✅ A cumulative flow diagram for a release
 > True. A cumulative flow diagram (if it only includes stories for the release) shows the progress (completed stories) against the total amount of work, so it can help track a release. In addition, it can help you understand story lead and cycle times.
 - ✅ A release burn-up chart
 > True. A release burn-up chart shows the progress (work done) against the total amount of work in a release.
 - ❌ An iteration burn-down chart
 - ❌ A weekly status report
 
 ## 🔹 Requirements and Planning

1. What is true about user stories in Agile Software Development?

  - ✅ User stories are tokens for conversations.
  - ❌ To be valid, a story MUST follow the following syntax template: "As a ____ I want to _______________ so that ____________________ ."
  - ✅ Stories can be written at different levels and can be refined and split into smaller stories as you move from vague idea to implemented software.
  - ❌ All stories have to be the same size.
  - ✅ User stories are used to plan, design, describe, build, and validate your product.
  > Watch video "User Stories: The currency of agile development". User stories are the primary unit around which all of agile development revolves. You define user requirements as user stories, you estimate them, and you create plans based on them. Software is built story by story.
  
2. What are some of the benefits of writing acceptance tests for a story?

  - ✅ They help the product owner (who is writing the story) think through the user needs.
  - ❌ They make sure the story is easy to develop.
  - ✅ They help you write tests cases for the story.
  > Watch video "User Stories: The currency of agile development". Acceptance tests provide an idea as to what do we need to validate.
  - ✅ They help build a common understanding between team members.
  - ✅ They can potentially help you split stories, if required.

3. What is wrong with the following story?

**_"As a product owner, I want a list of highly-rated restaurants on the brochure."_**

  - ✅ It doesn't specify the value of the story (the "why" is missing).
  > True. The story is missing the "so that" part of the story.
  - ✅ The user who benefits from this story is missing (the "who" is missing).
  > True. The Product Owner is the person writing the user story not the type of user who wants the list of highly-rated restaurants.
  - ❌ The story is not small.
  - ❌ The story is not negotiable.

4. What is wrong with following user story?

**_"I want the software to be easy to use."_**

  - ✅ It is not testable.
  > True. It does not describe what "easy to use" means.
  - ❌ The story is not valuable.
  - ❌ The story is very big.
  - ✅ No valid user is identified.
  > It does not specify the user this story is written for.

5. How is gathering user needs / requirements different on an agile project?

  - ✅ At any given time, the level of detail may be different for different parts of the software.
  - ✅ The agile way supports progressive refinement---defining the right level of detail at the right time.
  - ✅ Agile encourages conversations as a key method for building a shared understanding.
  - ❌ In agile, we don't waste time on understanding user needs. Instead, we build something, show it to the user, and learn.

6. What are some of the activities that happen during a User Story Writing Workshop?

  - ✅ User role analysis and defining personas
  - ✅ To generate stories, one of the options is to start from the top down or bottom up.
  - ✅ Sometimes, you keep it free-form for people to write stories and later group them by theme.
  - ❌ The leaders from the organization lay out exactly what needs to be built.
  - ✅ Everybody silently writes user stories around a theme

7. Which of the following are true about the Story Mapping technique? (select 3)

  - ✅ It is a user-centric approach where we map out the system from a user's perspective.
  > Do we focus on the user when developing a story map? Watch video "Generating User Stories"
  - ❌ Only the product owner and users attend the story mapping exercise.
  - ✅ The horizontal axis (moving from left to right) in a story map represents time.
  - ✅ The vertical axis (moving from top to bottom) in a story map represents rough priority.
  - ❌ One story map can only have one user. It is not recommended to have multiple users on same story map.

8. Due to an unpredictable market event, the Product Owner (PO) asked the team to complete the next release in 6 weeks. Assuming the backlog in Table 2 is up to date and prioritized from highest to lowest, the Product Owner wants you to estimate what can be done in next 6 weeks. Describe 1) what can be done, 2) what might be done, and 3) what will not be done.

  - The velocity range to be used for the release planning is 15-22.
  - The team works in 2 week iteration.
  
Table 2: Prioritized Product Backlog

  - ✅ Most likely: Story 1 to Story 8; Might Be Done: Story 9 to Story 13; Not likely: Rest of the stories
  - ❌ Most likely: Story 1 to Story 9; Might be Done: Story 10; Not likely: Rest of the stories
  - ❌ Most likely: Story 1 to Story 11; Might be Done: Story 12 and 13; Not likely: Rest of the stories
  > Correct! You calculated the total number of story points you could complete with the minimum velocity (15) in 6 weeks (3 iterations), and did the same with the maximum velocity (22). You then used those values to see what you can do and not do.

9. What is true about planning with an agile mindset?

  - ✅ Use Adaptive Planning.
  - ❌ Planning is mostly done by project manager.
  - ❌ Plan as little as you can. Planning is considered a non-productive activity.
  - ✅ Plan just enough, just in time.

10. What do we mean by Velocity in agile terms?

  - ❌ It is calculated at the team level and represents the estimated duration of current iteration.
  - ✅ It is calculated at the team level and represents how much work a team can get done in an iteration.
  - ❌ It is a velocity of the individual team members, not the team
  - ❌ It represents actual work done in the first iteration of project.
